I'm Cristobal Campos. I worked at INIA Chile (National Institute of Agricultural Research).

My research interests include Geographic Information Science (GIS), 
remote sensing, and environmental modeling. More specifically, 
I am interested in applying geospatial big data, machine learning,
and cloud computing (e.g., Google Earth Engine).
